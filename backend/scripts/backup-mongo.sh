# Dumps MONGO_URI via mongodump and uploads the archive to an S3-compatible
# bucket (Cloudflare R2, S3, etc). Designed to run from GitHub Actions
# (.github/workflows/backup-mongo.yml) but works locally too.
#
# Required:
#   MONGO_URI               — same secret data-pipeline.yml already uses
# Required for upload (soft-skip with exit 0 if any are missing — lets this
# run safely before a backup bucket has been provisioned, see tech-defaults.md
# "Cần bạn thao tác thủ công"):
#   BACKUP_S3_ENDPOINT       — e.g. https://<account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
#   BACKUP_S3_BUCKET         — bucket name
#   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
#   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
# Optional:
#   BACKUP_MIN_SIZE_BYTES    — guard threshold, default 10240 (10 KiB).
#                              A dump smaller than this is treated as a
#                              failure ("succeeded but empty"), not a success.
