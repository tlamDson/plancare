/**
 * Test double for `@clerk/express`, wired in via `resolve.alias` in
 * vitest.integration.config.ts — so EVERY integration test file runs against
 * this stub, never against real Clerk session verification. Auth identity
 * comes from the `x-test-user-id` request header (see `asUser()` in
 * integration-fixtures.ts).
 *
 * This replaces the `vi.mock("@clerk/express", ...)` block that used to be
 * copy-pasted byte-identical into every integration test file — `vi.mock` is
 * hoisted above imports, so a shared helper can't be a plain imported
 * function; aliasing the module at resolution time sidesteps that.
 *
 * Consequence to be aware of: no integration test can exercise real Clerk
 * middleware behavior. That is intentional — token verification is Clerk's
 * responsibility; the E2E layer covers the real end-to-end token path.
